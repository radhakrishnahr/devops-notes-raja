virtual machines :
------------------

> vm can be created under any RG and RG can be a part of Subscription.
> If we create vm, few other azure resources can be generated : vm, vnet, subnet, public IP, OsDisk, Network Interface, Network Security Group
> We can resize vm
> We can connect windows server using RDP (SSH, bastion)
> We can install (Web server) any features from server manager > Add Roles and features
> VM > DISKS > we can see os level disk which is managed disk(C:) for high available [ there is also temp disk(D:) is available which is not managable]
> When we deploy a vm, azure allocates public ip and private ip. 
> Using public ip (is another azure resource) we use rdp to connect with remote windows vm.
> Using private ip we can internally communicate within vnet.
> By default azure allocates static public ip by default. static public ip will not be change when we deallocating and reallocating the vm.
> public ip is dynamic in nature. If deallocate and reallocate vm, dynamic public ip will change.


Sizes of vm's :

1. General purpose [ ideal for testing and devleopment ] : B, Dsv3, DC, DCv2...etc
2. Compute optimized [ good for medium traffic web servers ] : F, Fs, Fsv2, FX
3. Memory optimized [ great for relatinal database servers ] : Esv2, Ev3, DVv2, M ...etc
4. Storage optimized [ Ideal for bigdata, sql,nosql databases ] : Lsv2,Lsv3, Lasv3
5. GPU [Specialized virtual machines targeted for heavy graphic rendering and video editing] : NC, NCv2, NCv3, NCasT4_v3...etc
6. Hign performance compute [Our fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA).] : HB, HBv2, HBv3, HC

Windows / Linux Virtual Machines Pricing :

-> windows vm pricing depends on type of OS/software and region.
-> If we have any windows liecence, based on that liecence we'll get instant discount (Show Azure Hybrid Benefit pricing) on windows vm.
-> When we deploy an azure vm, based on its OS and region azzure will charge only for the vm only. Pricing for the other resources such as disk, vnet ..etc will be charged separately.

Why do we choose Region ?

> Region is geographical location of azure datacenter.
> In side a datacenter, we can have many racks of physical servers.
> Some services are available in region level and some are available in global level.
> based on azure service availability in the region, cost, distance to the users we need to choose region.

> Resource Group : logical entity to group of azure resources. Each resource is must be part of RG. A resource can't be part of multiple RG's or multiple subscriptions.
> Azure Marketplace for virtual machines : We can deploy required application from azure marketplace through the vm.
> Availability sets : It is a logical grouping of vm's. It helps to improve the entire availability of your application.
	> When physical server in datacenter is downdue to any fault / under maintenence, In such case, availability set helps to manage these issues through Fault domain and Update domain.
	> Update domain : Here Azure will apply updates to the physical infrastructure one update domain at a time.
	> Fault domain : Here the vm in the fault domain share a common power source and network switch.
	> There is no additional cost for availability set. Charges for underlying vm'see
	> Availability set is not reposible for to create vm's. It only manages availabilityof your machines.
	> Availability set is not replicate the data acroos the VM's.
> Availability zones : These are physical locations of datacenters in side the region. It is useful for the high availability of your application.
	> There is no cost of AZ's but there is a cost of data transfer per GB between AZ's. AZ will not replicate your application. It manages your app in AZ's. It is your responsibility to replicate your application in different AZ's.
> Azure dedicated host : It provides hardware isolation and no other vm's will be placed on the host. You can control maintenence events.
> Virtual machine scale set service : This service is resposible for to increase or decrease your resources automatically as per the demand. 

Azure Web App :
---------------

> If we want to host a web app on azure, we can use this service. This is PaaS.
> Azure only manages underlying infrastructure.
> This service can also scale up /down based on demand.
> This service has support for .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, Python.
> When we are creating Web app service, we need choose 'App Service Plan' for pricing purpose. It has Free F1, Shared D1, Basic B1 ,Standard S1, Premium V3 and Isolated V2 plans.

Azure Functions : 
----------------

> It is a Serverless service to host your function code in Azure.
> These is also an option to only pay based on your comsumption( no of invocations) of the function.
> There is support for c#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell and Python etc
> It only charges for computation time of yout funtion in Azure's physical server.
> You no need to take care of any Infrastructure. 
> It has three plans ( Consumption(serverless), functions premium, app service plan )

Containers :
------------

> Isolate our application using container. It is light weighted and easy to export in any environment.
> We can run our application using container runtime such as docker.
> for to manage microserve based application we need kubernetes.

Azure container instance service :
----------------------------------

> This service is used to deploy our application using container.
> We can upload images from public or private container registry
> Azure provides their own service named azure container registry to host public/private docker images.

Azure kubernetes :
------------------

> We can deploy fully managed kubernetes service using Azure.
> It has different plans like Standard, Dev/Test, ...

Azure Virtual Desktop :
-----------------------

> To deploy a virtual desktop. we need any liecence key and it prices for remotely connecting to the virtual desktop.
> To set up virtual desktop, we need to create vnet and host pool.
> From azure active directory, we need to assign liecence to the user.
> From your host pool you need to assign virtual desktop to the user.

Azure virtual network (vnet) :
------------------------------

> when we define vnet, we have to specify ip address range (10.0.0.0/16).
> we can define subnets with proper IP adderess range (10.0.1.0/24).
> subnet ip range would be sub set of ip address range of vnet.
> when vm is deployed, a private ip is assigned based on ip range of subnet.
> azure vnet is equivalent to on-premesis network. and also it is isolated azure network.
> out bound traffic to the internet is allowed by default to the vnet.
> *** There is no need to deploy any azure resource with in the same region of RG.
> within the vnet, two subnets will communicate each other using their private ip's.

Network Security Groups :
-------------------------

> When we create a vm, it first creates NSG with default firewall rules and it gets attached to the Network Interface and the VM.
> NSG is acts like basic firewall to allows only valid traffic to the VM from the Intetrnet.
> It is uses to filter network traffic to/from azure resources with in VNET.
> We can assiciate NSG with either Network Interface or a subnet.
> The NSG contains rules that are used to allow or deny  inbound and outbound traffic.
> The rules can also be applied to all VM's inside the network.
> Default Inbound rules are AllowVnetInBound (priority=65000), AllowAzureLoadBalanceInBound (65001), DenyAllInBound (65500)
> Default Outbound rules are AllowVnetOutBound (65000), AllInternetOutBound (65001), DenyAllOutBound (65500)

Application Security Group :
----------------------------

> We can define one rule that allows Inbound traffic from 10.0.1.4 to 10.0.0.4.
> But here there is a dependency on the IP addess.
> Instead you canmake newvm part of an Application Security Group -  Let's say app-asg
> And then define the rule in the NSG to allow traffic ffrom app-asg to 10.0.0.4.

Overview of VPN connections to thr Azure :
------------------------------------------

> To connect vm located with in vnet from on-preses private network, By establishing point to site VPN we can communicate using private IP of Individual machine. for this we need to create azure virtual network gateway.
> Another way is to use site to site VPN to communicate machines from on-premises network to azure vnet. It also requires azure virtual netwr=ork gateway and Local network gateway.

Azure Express Route :
---------------------

> Allows you to connect your on-premises networks to Microsoft cloud over the private connection. Here the connection is established with the help of a connectivity provider
> The ExpressRoute connection does not go over the public Internet.
> Your connections are more reliable, faster and you get less latency.
> You get two connections for each ExpressRoute circuit for redundancy,


Azure Load Balancer :
---------------------

> The Load Balancer is used to distribute incoming traffic and distribute to the backend Azure VMs.
> There are different SKU's ( Pricing models ) for the LB- Basic and Standard.
> Basic LB - Nocharge -  But there is no SLA ( Service Level Agreement ). and there are other features like no built-in high availability.
> Standard LB has an hourly charge. But you get different features like high availability via the use of Availability zones.
> Public IP address - if it is a public load balancer.
> Configure backed pool - need to group backend VM's as a pool.
> Need to configure Health probe - This is used to monitor the balanced machines.
> Need to create Load Balancing rules ( NAT rules ) - These are used to direct the requests coming into the LB to the balanced VMs.
> Basic LB should be a part of scale set or availability set.

Azure DNS Zone:
---------------

> You could access the web application via the Public IP address or the DNS allocated by Azure.
> You can route the user traffic to your application via your own domain name.
> You can use the Azure DNS service when it comes to name resolution.
> You can also use the Azure DNS system to manage the DNS records.

Azure virtual network peering :
-------------------------------

> An Azure vnet is an isolated network on the cloud.
> By defaultthe azure vm's can't communicate acroos azure vnet's.
> for this you have to create a azure vnet peering connection.
> We can peer from two different subscriptions and also we can peer from two different accounts.

Introduction to Azure Storage :
===============================

> Types of Azure storage accounts : 
		> Azure storage account - blob storage : 
		----------------------------------------
			> Is is an object storage best used to store unstructured data like videos, pics, audio files using Azure storage accounts.
			> Azure blob storage can grow automatically based on demand.
			> It is also good for storing backups.
		> Azure Storage account - file shares :
		---------------------------------------
			> Ex : Let us consider a company wants to maintain their each employee data. Then this serivce best suitable to fullfill this scenario.
		> Azure Storage account - table storage :
		-----------------------------------------
			> This is great when you want to store non-relational structured data. This is when you data conforms to a schemaless design.
		> Azure storage account - queue storage :
		-----------------------------------------
			> This is simple messaging based service.
> Storage account name should be unique.
> After creating storage account, we can see all types of storage accounts (containers, file shares, queues, tables) left side of storage account dashboard. 

BLOB service :
--------------

> create a storage account > click on container > create new container > upload files from local system / from any resource.
> It is object based storage system as it treats files as objects.
> We will get URL for each object. Using URL we can access the object through browser.
> To read data by anyone, we need to modify public access level to anonymous read access for blobs only. ( under container > beside upload > click on change access level )
> we can upload, modify or delete objects.

Azure Storage Accounts - Access tiers :
---------------------------------------

> Blob storage pricing :
	> Pricing is depends on  * Volume of data stored per month.
							 * Quantity and types of operations performed, along with any transfer costs.
							 * Data redundancy option selected.
							 * Based on file structure (flat namespace).
							 * data storage prices pay-as-you-go have different options like Premium, Hot, Cool, Archive.
				Premium			Hot				Cool 			Archive
				-------			---				----			-------
1st 50TB/month	$0.15.GB		$0.0184/GB		$0.01/GB		$0.00099/GB
Next 450T/m		$0.15.GB		$0.0177/GB		$0.01/GB		$0.00099/GB
Over 500T/m		$0.15.GB		$0.0170/GB		$0.01/GB		$0.00099/GB

> There is a cost for storing objects.
> There is a cost for accessing objects.
> Companies might store millions of objects in a storage account.
> Use case : Initial there could be some objects that are accessed quite frequently. Then after some time, may be a week or two, those objects are accessed less frequently.
	can company save on costs when it comes to less frequentlyaccessed objects. 
> An object can be set to a particular tier.
> Hot Access tier : This is optimized for objects accessed more frequently. ( here you have storage costs and lower access costs )
> Cool Access tier : This is optimized for objects accesed or modified less frequently. ( here you have less storage costs and high access costs )
		( Here data need to be stored for at least 30 days )
> Archive Acces tier : Good for longterm backups. ( here you have lower storage costs and very higher access costs ).
		( Here the data need to be stored for at least 180 days )
> We can set the hot and cool access tier at the storage account level.
> We can set the hot, cool and archive access tier at the blob level.
